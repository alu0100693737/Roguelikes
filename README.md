# Roguelikes
Role-playing video game.

Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games, characterized by procedural
generation of game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, permanent
death of the player-character, and typically based on a high fantasy narrative
setting.

Roguelikes descend from the 1980 game Rogue, particularly mirroring Rogue's
character- or sprite-based graphics. From 2000 onwards, new variations of
roguelikes incorporating other gameplay genres, thematic elements and graphical
styles have become popular, and are sometimes called "roguelike-like", "rogue-lite",
or "procedural death labyrinths" to reflect the variation from titles which mimic
the gameplay of traditional roguelikes more faithfully.
